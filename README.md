#Recommendations:
## 1.Target states with highest total contractor usage. Highest 5 are: NY, PA, NJ, OH, NC.
## 2. Prioritize CNA, LPN, RN roles. They have the highest total hours.
## 3. Use metrics like Contractor Dependency Ratio and Census to Staffing ratio to make more targeted sales pitches to providers with high urgency of contractors.
## 4. Target ‘For Profit’ ownership providers over ‘non profit and/or government’ providers. For Profits have higher overall volume of total hours.

## Since Clipboard health is a 2-sided marketplace, I will break down my analysis into multiple components and provide analysis that can help the sales team. First, I will focus on healthcare
professionals and then the providers.
